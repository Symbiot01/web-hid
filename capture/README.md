# Capture node (Raspberry Pi 4 + Camera Module 3)

Pi-side publisher for the operator console: **H.264 → MediaMTX** (`cam` path, SRT) and **outbound WS photo** to HID `/ws/capture`.  
No HID. No `/ws/device`. Video never shares sockets with the ESP32 path.

| Slice | Goal | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| **A** | Detect IMX708 + still JPEG | Run on Pi (scripts below) |
| **B** | Local 720p30 H.264 encode | Run on Pi |
| **C** | Publish live video to MediaMTX path `cam` | **SRT ingest** (see `docs/SLICE_C_SRT.md`) |
| **D** | `still_server.py` token HTTP | Optional local debug |
| **E** | Outbound WS photo → HID `POST /api/photo` | `scripts/capture_ws.py` + `camera_still.py` ([clash docs](docs/SLICE_E_STILL.md)) |
| **F** | Focus WHEP live video in UI | HID Focus/Split → `/cam/whep` |

**Still vs stream:** only one libcamera client. Snapshot briefly stops `whip.service`, then restarts it — see [`docs/SLICE_E_STILL.md`](docs/SLICE_E_STILL.md).

**Why not WHIP from Pi yet?** Distro `ffmpeg` failed as a WHIP client (`-f webrtc`); Stream-test on `/desk` already proved VPS 443+8189. We use **SRT → MediaMTX → WHEP** until a real WHIP client is on the Pi. Details: [`docs/SLICE_C_SRT.md`](docs/SLICE_C_SRT.md).

**Slice E (photo):** Pi dials **out** to `wss://webrelay…/ws/capture?token=…` (same idea as ESP32 `/ws/device`). No Tailscale / static Wi‑Fi IP. Same `CAPTURE_TOKEN` on Coolify HID and Pi `.env`.

### What’s next

1. Finish Pi ops: pull latest, sudoers + `capture-ws` unit (`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`), redeploy HID (20 s timeout), confirm Snapshot + `/cam` both work.
2. **Slice F** — replace Focus “camera placeholder” with WHEP from `https://mediarelay…/cam/whep` (live view while HID keys work).
3. Later: MediaMTX publish auth; optional true WHIP client; still without bouncing SRT.

Defaults: **1280×720 @ 30**. Not 1080 until 720 is stable.

## 1. Hardware & OS baseline

1. **Power off** the Pi 4.
2. CAMERA port (between audio and HDMI): lift collar, insert Module 3 ribbon (**silver contacts facing HDMI**), press collar down.
3. Power on, SSH in.
4. Update + camera apps:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y libcamera-apps
# On newer images the binary may be rpicam-*; package still provides the tools.
```

Clone or copy this repo to the Pi, e.g. `~/capture`.

---

## 2. Slice A — Detect & still

```bash
cd ~/capture
./scripts/slice_a_detect.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
rpicam-hello --list-cameras
# Expect one camera, imx708 (Module 3)

rpicam-still -n -o /tmp/test.jpg
```

**Headless view:**

```bash
cd /tmp && python3 -m http.server 8080
# Browser: http://<PI_IP>:8080/test.jpg  — then Ctrl+C
```

**Pass:** Sensor listed as `imx708`; JPEG looks correct.  
**Fail → stop.** Do not start WHIP or still server.

---

## 3. Slice B — Local H.264 (720p30)

```bash
cd ~/capture
./scripts/slice_b_encode.sh
```

Or:

```bash
rpicam-vid -t 10000 --width 1280 --height 720 --framerate 30 -o /tmp/test.h264
```

Watch for **10 s** with no libcamera buffer errors. Serve/download `/tmp/test.h264` and play in VLC if useful.

**Pass:** Clean 10 s encode. Then proceed to **Slice C**.

---

## 3b. Slice C — SRT live to `/cam`

```bash
cd ~/capture
# .env should include SRT_URL=srt://mediarelay…:8890?streamid=publish:cam&pkt_size=1316
./scripts/publish_whip.sh
# or: sudo systemctl enable --now whip.service  (see systemd/whip.service.example)
```

Open `https://mediarelay.sahilpatel.online/cam/`. Campus Wi‑Fi often blocks UDP 8890 — use WARP/VPN or an unfiltered uplink (see `docs/SLICE_C_SRT.md`).

**Conflict:** while `rpicam-vid` is running, a bare `rpicam-still` fails (camera busy). Slice E (`camera_still.py`) **briefly stops `whip.service`**, captures, then restarts it. Install passwordless sudo for that unit only — see `sudoers/capture-whip.sudoers`. Live `/cam` will glitch for ~1–3 s per Snapshot. Details: [`docs/SLICE_E_STILL.md`](docs/SLICE_E_STILL.md).

---

## 3c. LookCam instead of the Pi CSI camera

The operator Focus view already plays MediaMTX path `cam`. A LookCam does not use `rpicam-vid`. On its own access point it has no RTSP server. The laptop, or a phone on the same LAN, runs `scripts/lookcam_bridge.py`. That keeps the PPPP session, obeys the console, and uploads H.264 only while someone is watching the Stream tab. The console transcodes into MediaMTX. Settings commands from that tab use the same session. Handshake and command list: [`docs/LOOKCAM.md`](docs/LOOKCAM.md).

```bash
export BRIDGE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
export BRIDGE_TOKEN=...   # operator_console/.env, never commit it
export LOOKCAM_IFACE=wlo1
export LOOKCAM_BIND=192.168.100.22
python3 scripts/lookcam_bridge.py
```

`LOOKCAM_PASSWORD` belongs in `operator_console/.env`, not in the browser.

Stills (`rpicam-still`, Slice E) do not apply. Do not port-forward 554. Do not commit a packet capture or a URL that contains a password.

`publish_lookcam.sh` is only for a later RTSP URL. It does not speak PPPP. When a URL does play in VLC:

```bash
# Laptop MediaMTX (HTTP 8889 is published here; production compose is not)
cd HID/deploy/mediamtx
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build -d

# capture/.env (chmod 600), then:
cd capture
./scripts/publish_lookcam.sh
```

Play `http://127.0.0.1:8889/cam`. For the existing website, set `LOOKCAM_SRT_URL` to `srt://mediarelay.sahilpatel.online:8890?streamid=publish:cam&pkt_size=1316` and open Focus (`/cam/whep`). If copy fails, set `LOOKCAM_TRANSCODE=1`. Campus Wi-Fi may block UDP 8890 (see `docs/SLICE_C_SRT.md`).

---

## 4. Slice E — outbound WS photo

1. On Coolify HID: set `CAPTURE_TOKEN` (same value as Pi). Remove any old `CAPTURE_URL`. Redeploy HID.
2. On Pi:

```bash
cd ~/capture
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
cp env.example .env   # edit RELAY_WS_URL + CAPTURE_TOKEN
python3 scripts/capture_ws.py
# Expect: connecting wss://…/ws/capture  then  capture ws connected
```

3. Systemd (optional): copy `systemd/capture-ws.service.example`, adjust paths/user, `systemctl enable --now`.

4. Smoke: log into operator UI → Capture Online → Snapshot → lightbox JPEG.  
   Live `/cam` may drop for ~1–3 s while whip is restarted around the still.

**Pi sudo (required for Snapshot while whip is running):**

```bash
sudo cp ~/capture/sudoers/capture-whip.sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/capture-whip
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/capture-whip
sudo visudo -cf /etc/sudoers.d/capture-whip
# then: sudo systemctl restart capture-ws.service
```

---

## 5. Layout

```text
capture/
  README.md
  docs/LOOKCAM.md          # PPPP handshake and JSON commands
  env.example
  requirements.txt
  still_server.py          # Slice D optional LAN debug
  scripts/
    slice_a_detect.sh
    slice_b_encode.sh
    publish_whip.sh        # Slice C SRT → MediaMTX /cam
    publish_lookcam.sh     # RTSP camera → same SRT path cam
    lookcam_bridge.py      # PPPP session, server commands, Annex-B upload
    capture_ws.py          # Slice E outbound WS agent
  systemd/
    still.service.example
    whip.service.example
    capture-ws.service.example
```

Copy `env.example` → `/etc/hid-capture.env` or `~/capture/.env` (gitignored) before C/E.

---

## Security

- `CAPTURE_TOKEN` authenticates Pi → HID `/ws/capture` only. Not the UI gate password. Never log it.
- Still HTTP (`still_server.py`): optional **127.0.0.1** debug only; Slice E does not need it.
- Do not expose still port on `0.0.0.0/0`.
- MediaMTX / SRT: tighten auth before production.
